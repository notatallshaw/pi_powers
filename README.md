# pi_powers

An implementation of the calculations done in the video "Why π^π^π^π could be an integer (for all we know!)." found here: https://youtu.be/BdHFLfv-ThQ?t=608

Using Python's decimal module which can have arbitary precision. Matt states he stopped with Python when it "ran out of precision", I assume he was using foating point numbers
